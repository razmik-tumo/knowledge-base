# Student Registration

Here is a brief description of the application and registration process in Yerevan. International centers may have slightly different processes due to local regulations and privacy laws. For more detailed information please go over the Registration and Info Desk Manual.

##

#### Student Enrollment Process
Students stop by TUMO to apply, collect: Name, Date of Birth, Phone number for communication in TUMO 360  (Waiting List Form) 

If student/parent calls TUMO for application: an automatic message asks the caller to leave a voice message with the same info (voice recordings are saved in a system and manually added to the system)

Student or parent gets added to the “Waiting list form”. TUMO will contact the student or parent via SMS within thirty days of them joining the waitlist.  

New students over 18 should be informed that they are too old to enroll in TUMO.

#### SMS Invite for Registration
If a student is under 18 their parent will receive the SMS if the student is 18 than they receive SMS with the following information for a registration appointment at TUMO:

Date, Time, Documents needed for registration: ID / Passport & Birth certificate of student and parents passports 

If date doesn’t suit parent/student, they call back and schedule a new date with call center operator

#### Registration Process  
Parent with the student (if the student is below 18) comes to TUMO for registration on the date and time mentioned in the SMS. 

Registration collects and photocopies any required documents (student and parent, if applicable IDs/Passports or Birth Certificates).

Registration then enters the information into the TUMO 360 and prints out 2 copies of the contract which is signed by both parents / or students who are 18.

Registration takes a photo of students via webcam which is used on the student’s RFID access card (access cards are typically issued only after the student’s second class)

The student’s account, passcard, and google email account will be activated automatically the day before the attendance start date.

The registration process is amended for cases when only one of the parents accompanies the student for registration, we use a contract with an amendment for cases such as divorced / single parents.

Student schedules and attendance start dates are all set during the registration process 

Registration checks TUMO 360 to see what sessions have the capacity and works with the student to schedule a convenient time

After parent confirmation, the schedule is added to the student’s profile in T360

A week before their assigned start date, students and parents are invited to an orientation presentation at TUMO. In Yerevan, this is an automated message. 

Students must attend an orientation presentation before their first session, therefore presentation evenings should be held frequently to accommodate parent/student schedules.
