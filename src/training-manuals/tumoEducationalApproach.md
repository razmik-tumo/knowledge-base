# TUMO Education Approach

The TUMO Center for Creative Technologies is an educational program that puts teenagers in charge of their own learning.

Teens combine the TUMO learning targets in their own personal learning plans, which are always adapting to fit their progress and evolving preferences. Soft skills, such as teamwork, initiative-taking, empathy, and effective communication, are built into the educational program along with content area know-how and technical skills. 

There are no student cohorts at TUMO – students of all ages, social background and interests work together at various times in different workshops and labs; no entrance exams, requirements or fees – all applicants are accepted free of charge; no grades – students do not compete with each other, but are rather motivated to gain access to their favorite workshops and labs, and to level up, as they would in a video game; and no certificate of completion – instead, each student's work is automatically uploaded to their online portfolio, which becomes their "living diploma."

## The Program and The Learning Targets

TUMO is a hands-on learning environment where each student has a unique software-based learning path [TUMO Path] which is automatically generated based on student preferences, performance, and constantly adapts to fit their evolving interests.

As a note, international centers often select between eight and ten skills to offer based on the number of students in each learning group. Offered skills are selected based on what is popular at TUMO and the local context. 

The program alternates independent learning activities supported by coaches, with hands-on workshops taught by the center's specialized staff, and project labs led by industry leaders from across the globe. 

To complete a minimal program it takes around two years if the student is attending for 1-2 sessions per week, 1.5-2 hour per session. The students visit the TUMO premises once or twice a week at some centers to work on self-learning activities. Students have scheduled access which means they can only access the system during assigned sessions.

## The Three Educational Pillars

There are three interdependent modes of learning at TUMO, and together they make up each student’s personal learning path.


Self-learning consists of activities that are designed to be completed in roughly 90-minutes through completion times vary between activities. Activities are bite-sized learning modules designed to teach one or two specific skills. Self-learning activities build on each other and ensure that students understand a skill before moving on. Learning coaches help get students “unstuck” and provide guidance to students during the self-learning phase.  Coaches are often university students, and many are former TUMO students themselves. Beyond technical assistance, coaches establish relationships with students, mentoring, and motivating them to prepare for upcoming workshops and learning labs. 

The self-learning activities prepare students for workshops that combine multiple skills in the discipline. Activities combine written, video, audio educational content to keep students engaged. Students answer questions throughout an activity and digitally submit a small topical project at the end. TUMO workshop leaders provide detailed feedback on all activity submissions, passing or rejecting each one.  Some activities are created entirely within TUMO while the majority have third party content, such as tutorials or tools integrated into the standard structure. Each activity is related to one or several skills and can include learning objectives related to one or more skills. Some activities are interdependent, which means students can only unlock the activity when they have completed the preceding activity.

Workshops are month-long, project-based learning modules led by workshop leaders. Workshop leaders are professionals with years of experience in their fields. Each learning target offered at the center has three levels of the workshop: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Each workshop is separated by three increasingly difficult prerequisite activities.  A workshop spans four weeks, with two sessions per week. Workshops are repeated on a cyclical basis and because students work on multiple learning targets simultaneously, they always have a workshop to anticipate and work toward. Workshops average around 16 students. Workshops’ structure and syllabi follow the pedagogical approach developed by TUMO.

Learning Labs are ad hoc workshops. They are made available whenever TUMO can recruit a top professional, often from abroad, who is willing to volunteer 2-4 weeks of their time to teach a specialized, project-based workshop. Learning labs have been led by mid-career professionals from major companies such as Pixar and Google, as well as successful freelancers, startup founders, and students at major universities. Close to 160 learning labs are offered each year, averaging around 8 participating students. Unlike regular workshops to which all students have access, learning labs are competitive. Each lab leader sets minimum requirements for participants, such as the completion of the advanced programming workshop, and may require an application that includes the submission of sample work. The lab leader will select participants from the resulting pool of students, which typically exceeds the number of spots available.
