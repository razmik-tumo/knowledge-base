# Student Account Statuses

All TUMO students, past and present, have an account status which is formally tracked in the TUMO 360 software. Here we define the various possible account statuses. As a note, students can move between statuses based on their attendance and participation.

#### Registration Process  
Parent with the student (if the student is below 18) comes to TUMO for registration on the date and time mentioned in the SMS. 

Registration collects and photocopies any required documents (student and parent, if applicable IDs/Passports or Birth Certificates).

Registration then enters the information into the TUMO 360 and prints out 2 copies of the contract which is signed by both parents / or students who are 18.

Registration takes a photo of students via webcam which is used on the student’s RFID access card (access cards are typically issued only after the student’s second class)

The student’s account, passcard, and google email account will be activated automatically the day before the attendance start date.

The registration process is amended for cases when only one of the parents accompanies the student for registration, we use a contract with an amendment for cases such as divorced / single parents.

Student schedules and attendance start dates are all set during the registration process 

Registration checks TUMO 360 to see what sessions have the capacity and works with the student to schedule a convenient time

After parent confirmation, the schedule is added to the student’s profile in T360

A week before their assigned start date, students and parents are invited to an orientation presentation at TUMO. In Yerevan, this is an automated message. 

Students must attend an orientation presentation before their first session, therefore presentation evenings should be held frequently to accommodate parent/student schedules.
